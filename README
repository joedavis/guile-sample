Sample-guile is an example of how to distribute programs and modules
written fully in guile.

guile-sample, the main program or script, is created from guile-sample.in
when processed by configure. This is needed to ensure that the shebang
line is correct.

Also included is guile.m4, which defined AX_PROG_GUILE a *very* simple
macro to search for the guile interpreter.

An example module '(guile-sample hello), used by the guile sample script,
is included.
